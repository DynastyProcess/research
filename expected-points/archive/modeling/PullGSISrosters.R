# Author: Ron Yurko
# Purpose: Scripts for scraping team rosters and player IDs from NFL.com
# This code is adapted from the original functions from GameandRosterFunctions.R

#' Get team roster for a single season
#' 
#' Given a year and team abbreviation, return a dataset with each
#' player who has played the specified team and has recorded a measurable statistic.
#' 
#' @param season A 4-digit year associated with a given NFL season
#' @param teams A string vector containing the abbreviations for NFL Team(s)
#' @param type String indicating the type of game, must either be: "pre", 
#' "reg", or "post".
#' @param positions A string vector containing the abbreviations for NFL position(s).
#' Can be any of the following:
#' \itemize{
#' \item{"QUARTERBACK"} (in the default list)
#' \item{"RUNNING_BACK"} (in the default list)
#' \item{"WIDE_RECEIVER"} (in the default list)
#' \item{"TIGHT_END"} (in the default list)
#' \item{"DEFENSIVE_LINEMAN"} 
#' \item{"LINEBACKER"}
#' \item{"DEFENSIVE_BACK"}
#' \item{"KICKOFF_KICKER"}
#' \item{"KICK_RETURNER"}
#' \item{"PUNTER"}
#' \item{"PUNT_RETURNER"}
#' \item{"FIELD_GOAL_KICKER"}
#' }
#' @details To find team associated abbrevations use the \code{\link{nflteams}} dataset 
#' stored in this package!
#' @return A dataset with columns associated with season/year, full player name,
#' team initial, position, and formated player name.
#' @examples
#' # Roster for Steelers in 2018
#' get_season_rosters(2018, teams = "PIT") 
#' @export
